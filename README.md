# Career Tracker iOS App

This app started off as my startup idea with a purpose of supporting job seekers and working professionals in enhancing their career journey and experience through the following features:

1. Skill Narration: A unique journaling feature to record relevant stories users have gone through or encountered which can be used to leverage their expertise and experiences to show that they are the right person for the job. 
2. Interview Preparation: The app provides a question bank consisting of behavioural interview questions. Users can record their responses to each question via voice or video recording and analyse the accuracy and delivery of their answers. 
3. Job Application Tracker: The app aids users in managing their job applications by allowing them to track the status of each application. 
4. Calendars and Notifications: Users can add dates of interviews into the in-app calendar and schedule their own notifications on the app to remind them of when they should start preparing for the interview. 
5. Visualisations: The app includes charts to provide insights on their skills, job application metrics, and interview performance for analysis.

This idea was implemented in the FIT3178 unit and further developed after.

I have created a diagram to visualise how I expect users to navigate this app. The link is attached [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1_Mji7CNUxbSY_hb37rr4Y05LtWtXQMjkkiloIBrgjY8/edit?usp=sharing).
